    <h2>Why strengthen digital infrastructure</h2>

    <p>Without a free, open, and secure digital infrastructure, we - individuals, communities, businesses, academia, and government - cannot benefit from the digital transformation. Examples of digital infrastructure include code libraries or standardized protocols used by developers to write and test application software. These trusted components ensure that information can be translated freely from user to machine and back again. Available, accessible, and secure digital infrastructure is the foundation for digitalization in the public interest.</p>

    <p>The creation of a new funding program specifically for this software domain is therefore intended to support the development and maintenance of digital infrastructure.</p>

    <blockquote>Mission Statement:</br>
    The Digital Infrastructure Fund supports the development, enhancement and maintenance of enabling technologies of the Internet. The goal of the Fund is to sustainably strengthen the open source ecosystem, with a focus on security, resilience, and the people behind the code.</blockquote>

    <h2>Our approach</h2>

    <p>In the course of a feasibility study, the needs and possibilities of such a funding program will be examined in a first step. The primary goal is to maintain, scale, and secure digital infrastructure. The open source ecosystem should thus be maintained and strengthened to ensure not only secure and resilient digital infrastructures, but also sustainability and competitiveness in general. The idea is modeled on the OTF Core Infrastructure Fund and can learn from it as well as other programs, such as the Prototype Fund, and adopt practices that have already been tried and tested.</p>
